"The research which created this data discusses the importance of context. Whether or not they were personally offended by specific offensive language or gestures was not usually participantsâ€™
starting point. Instead, they were more likely to reflect on the acceptability of language or gestures in a particular context,
including whether others would be offended or harmed. Participants considered the following contextual factors
particularly important when making judgements about the acceptability of potentially offensive language on TV or radio:

1. The time of broadcast, and the potential and likely audiences
2. The frequency or repetition of potentially offensive language
3. Audience expectations of broadcasters, programmes, genres and medium
4. Audience expectations of live and pre-recorded programmes
5. The role of mitigating actions such as warnings, bleeps or apologies
6. The perceived tone and intent of programmes
